## <center>Internship</center>

<center>2021.03 - 2021.06 <br>
TikTok, Search Recommendation, ByteDance, Beijing, China<br>
Algorithm Engineer<br>
①  Toutiao: Read and learn the architecture code and business logic of recommendation system of Toutiao<br>
②  Realization the i18n query mining project; Realize the day and hour-level, on-site hot stickers and music posting recalls;<br>
Access correction and word-cut services for preprocess; Word embedding is used to eliminate duplication,<br>
sudden increment level and TnS offline security conclusion are used to filter; The post-processing access to NER service,<br>
and creatively designed the Search-After-Search mining to get the query context; A comprehensive Grafana monitoring has been built.
<br>
③  It has covered Britain, US, Russia, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. <br>
 1000 queries are mined and send to audit and Kafka message queues every day, also been broadcast to overseas operators through lark robot; <br>
 Through the synchronization of the Redis in the east United States and Singapore, the problem of repeated submission for audit is solved; <br>
 The proportion of on-site queries deployed by overseas operators increased significantly, with 10% ~ 50% in Britain, 20% ~ 70% in Japan and 30% ~ 50% in Russia.
<br>
④  Build audit queues, its interface displays query information and provides four kinds of audit operations: timeliness annotation, postpone, word-change and rejection;<br> Implement callback methods to write the audit results to Kafka, SQL, Redis and Tbase, and write to forward index through the offline data flow framework.<br>
⑤  Construct a Hive table for audit result and synchronize it to Clickhouse table, the historical audit data are recharged in a daily basis,<br>
so that the number of online candidates will not be reduced due to the expiration of timeliness; <br>
Based on the approved and rejected query, the analysis of its sudden increment and forward index fields is carried out to improve the mining effect; <br> 
Audit situation analysis dashboard is built based on VBA, which can comprehensively monitor into the audit situation, online available words account for 35%.<br> 
⑥  Realize the recall of time-sensitive query with semantic de-duplication and scattering mechanism, modify the service configuration<br>
and DAG topology to make it a recall for online gs and search-bar scenes; Carried out a week of 50% traffic AB Experiment:<br>
click pv +16.66%, ctr +16.84% for gs. click pv +3.42%, ctr + 0.11% for search-bar. The experimental effect is significantly positive, and has been fully online.
⑦  Realize the recall of QSE query, modify the service configuration and DAG topology to make it a recall for online rs and click recom scenes;<br>
Carried out 3 days of 20% traffic AB Experiment: click pv +11.5%, ctr +10.6% for rs, click pv +1.43%, ctr +0.43% for search-bar.
The experimental effect is significantly positive, and has been fully online.
